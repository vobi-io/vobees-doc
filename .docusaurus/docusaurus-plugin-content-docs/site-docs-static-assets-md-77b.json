  "description": "In general, every website needs assets: images, stylesheets, favicons and etc. In such cases, you can create a directory named `static` at the root of your project. Every file you put into that directory will be copied into the the root of the generated `build` folder with the directory hierarchy preserved. E.g. if you add a file named `sun.jpg` to the static folder, itâ€™ll be copied to `build/sun.jpg`.",
