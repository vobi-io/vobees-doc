This is an **early and alpha release** of Docusaurus 2. We are making it available early to maximize community participation and feedback. Expect it to evolve a lot over the course of the alpha-beta period. If you are adventurous enough to be an early adopter, chat with us on [**Discord**](https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus) :wink:.
